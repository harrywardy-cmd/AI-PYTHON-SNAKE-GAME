# AI-PYTHON-SNAKE-GAME
I want to see if I can learn how to make a classic python game only using chatGBT as my teacher, to keep this interesting I want to see how far AI goes as a tool to improve my own development practice


please see the prompt I have fed to the AI

"I want to program a snake game using python on my mac book air. Please teach me how to program a snake game with professional coding practises in the language of python that will work on both windows and mac OS."

We'll create a Snake game using Python with the pygame library, which works on both Windows and macOS. Below is the plan:

Steps:
Install Dependencies
Ensure you have pygame installed. Run:

pip install pygame


Game Structure

Use object-oriented programming (OOP) for maintainability.
Follow PEP 8 coding style.
Keep modularity with separate functions for game logic, rendering, and input handling.
Key Features

A moving snake that grows when eating food.
Collision detection (self and wall).
Score tracking.
Smooth game loop with pygame.

Explanation:
Snake Class: Handles movement, growth, and collision detection.
Food Class: Spawns food at random grid-aligned positions.
Main Loop:
Processes user input.
Moves the snake.
Checks for food consumption and collisions.
Renders graphics.
This is a clean, modular approach following professional coding practices. Let me know if you want enhancements like a scoring system or UI improvements! ðŸš€
